class MiscController < ActionController::Base
  # This controller is intended for things that don't need all of the
  # complex setup that happens in ApplicationController. If you have
  # actions that don't need things like authentication, current_user,
  # etc. then you can place them here and they will execute more
  # quickly.
  # Also notably, nothing in the chain before this accesses session[],
  # so if a session does not already exist *it will not be created*
  # unless you action accesses session[].
